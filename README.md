## Todo App with React/Redux


* I created this to better learn redux with asynchronous actions
* I just use a mock server `json-server` to emulate a REST api
* I started off a simple todo app with states following the videos lessons for https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-production-quality-react-app
* Then I rewrote it to use redux instead. I think this is the best way to learn redux and thunk.
