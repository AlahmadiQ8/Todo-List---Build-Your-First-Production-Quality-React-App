## Todo App with React/Redux & server fetching 


* I created this to better learn redux with asynchronous actions
* I just use a mock server `json-server` to emulate a REST api
* I started off a simple todo app with states following the [egghead videos lessons](https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-production-quality-react-app)
* Then I rewrote it to use redux instead. I think this is the best way to learn redux and thunk.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start    # will run both dev-server and mock-server
```

Todo list will by synced with `db.json`.
